Fizzbuzz Java
====================

A fizzbuzz practice project created in [Java] to help me learn the language. The
project was built from scratch on the command line using [Gradle] to manage the
dependencies and [jUnit] to write the tests.

To Do
-----

This was fun, but to get more of a grasp of the basics I need to write a Java
project with multiple classes and use like [Mockito] to create mocks.
